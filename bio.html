	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p id="bio">I was raised in Arlington, MA, the oldest of four siblings.
	   I attended Arlington High School and graduated in the spring of 2016.
	   I enrolled at Tufts University in the fall of 2016 as an undergraduate
	   engineering student. Originally a chemical engineering major, I
	   changed my major to computer science after taking the intro course
	   in the spring of my freshman year. I interned at ForgeAI the following
	   summer, a startup located in Central Square which focuses on developing
	   artificial intelligence models for natural language processing. I
	   returned to Forge the following winter break. I am now in the second
	   semester of my sophomore year at Tufts.</p>
